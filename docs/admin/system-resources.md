# System Resources

The system resources required depend on the number of users, the size of the schema and the size of the data to be tested.

Typically large data requires more memory and more than one concurrent users requires more CPU.

## Recommended minimum system specifications

For good performance that returns test results promptly on data files that are `< 5MiB` the minimum system specification is:

- 2 CPU cores
- 2 GiB of RAM
- 5 GiB of Storage
